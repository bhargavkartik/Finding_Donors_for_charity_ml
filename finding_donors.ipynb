    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "## 1. Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications: \n",
    "Gradient Boosting (GB) models can be used for both regression and classification tasks. They are one of the most common algorithms which are used is Kaggle machine learning competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "GB classifiers are less likely to overfit the training data as compared to a single decision tree. It reduces the amount of bias in the final predictor. The final classifier is usually stronger than an individual tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages: \n",
    "GB loses the interpretability of decision trees as the ﬁnal classiﬁer is a weighted sum of trees, which cannot necessarily be represented by a single tree. GB is also more computationally expensive than the use of a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suitability:\n",
    "GB might be more suitable than LR models with respect to this task due to the potential presence of multicollinearity in the data. In addition, the use of a GB classifier is more likely to reduce overfitting as compared to a single decision tree, and it does so by iteratively fitting new trees to better classify the mistakes made by older trees. In addition, the entire dataset is used by each tree in each iteration of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### References\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc411h/winter/lec/week11/ensembles.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/datamining/lectures/25-boost.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications: \n",
    "Logistic Regression (LR) is primarily used in classification tasks. For example, it can be used to assess the risk of cardio-vascular disease based on current health and habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages: \n",
    "LR is relatively robust. It does not require a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. In addition, the error terms (residuals) do not need to be normally distributed. Furthermore, homoscedasticity (same finite variance across all random variables) is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages: \n",
    "Since the decision boundary of a LR model is linear and singular, it tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries in the dataset. In addition, LR requires the observations to be independent of each other. LR will also not perform well in the presence of multicolinearity among the independent variables. This means that the model requires independent variables to be not too highly correlated with each other. Finally, LR requires a large sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suitability: \n",
    "LR models tend to work well even in general, since it does not require linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. It is also relatively fast and computationally inexpensive. However, there seems to be some dependent variables in the feature set, for example: education_level and education_num, maritial_status and relationship, capital_gain and capital_loss. Hence, the performance of LR model may be worse than other approaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications:\n",
    "Random Forest (RF) classifiers can be used in various classification tasks. For example, RF can be used to classify different types of samples using gene expression of microarrays data, identify disease associated genes from genome wide association studies, recognize important elements in protein sequences, or identify protein-protein interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages: \n",
    "RF classifiers reduce the amount of variance (overfitting) by averaging predictions from a collection of different decision trees. RF classifiers are also easy to parallelize. In addtion, increasing the number of trees will not lead to an increase in overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "RF classifier does not reduce bias in the model. Likewise with GB classifiers, RF also loses the interpretability of decision trees, and it is also more computationally expensive than a single decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suitability:\n",
    "In contrast to GB classifiers, RF classifier attempts to reduce the amount of overfitting by creating less corelated trees through bagging (sampling a smaller subset of training data) and also through subsampling a smaller feature set with each tree.\n",

    "When 100% of the training data is used, the Gradient Boosting (GB) classifier has the highest F-score, followed closely by Logistic Regression (LR) and the Random Forest (RF) classifier respectively. It also has the highest test accuracy score. The RF classifier exhibits some degree of overfitting since it has extremely high training accuracy and training F-score in contrast to its testing metrics. on the other hand, GB classifier and LR exhibit less overfitting.\n",

    "However, we do note that the GB classifier does take the longest training time among the three models, and it is significantly longer than the other two models. Its testing time lies in the middle between the RF classifier and LR model. For this particular task, the training time (~20 secs) is still within acceptable time limit, hence the GB Classifier is the best model."

    "Gradient Boosting (GB) is an ensemble method that combines a group of many different 'weak' learners into a single 'strong' learner. Typically each learner is a single decision tree, although other models can be used as well. The use of a single decision tree would tend to result in a model that overfits the data, especially if the tree has many levels and can 'memorize' the training data. GB classifiers attempt to minimize the possibility by overfitting, by fitting a series of smaller decision trees that are each contain fewer levels. In addition, at each iteration of the GB algorithm, every subsequent new tree will focus on classifying the mistakes made by the previous decision trees correctly. Because each new tree focuses on classifying older mistakes, we will have a collection of many decision trees that are substantially different from each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most important feature in the Gradient Boosting model is capital gain. Capital gain was in my top 5 features discussed in Question 6, although I ranked it third. This makes sense, since higher capital gain should correlate with higher income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most important feature in the model is capital loss, which was not in my top 5 features. From an intuitive perspective, capital loss is negatively correlated with high income level (>50K), since you are less likely to have a higher income if you are losing more in investments. Hence, it is logical that it will be in the top 5 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third most important feature in the model is Marital Status, and it is in my top 5 features. Married people usually earn more as they will be, for the most part, managing the expenses of them and their spouses and sometimes even kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fourth and fifth most important features are age and education, which were both in my top 5 features. This suggests that work experience could have a slightly bigger impact on income level than education. Overall, the feature weights of each of the top 5 features were relatively close. This suggests that the magnitude of importance of these features were relatively close."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
